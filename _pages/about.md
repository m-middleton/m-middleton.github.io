I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Dr. Leanne Hirshfield.

My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, human factors, and aviation. I am especially interested in three things: studying the brain at an idiographic, person centered level; understanding how high performance individuals think and perform under pressure; and using passive neuroimaging to build adaptive human computer interfaces that respond to a person’s cognitive state in real time.

In addition to my PhD work, I am a principal researcher and software engineer for the HAPII Lab at Northrop Grumman, where I design and build neuroadaptive systems and tools to better understand and support humans in complex operational environments.

Across these roles, my goal is to turn rich neurophysiological and behavioral data into practical systems that make high stakes work safer, more efficient, and more human centered.
