I am a first year PhD student at NYU interested in the intersection between procedural content generation and neuroimaging. I am advised by Erdem Varol, Claudio Silva, and Julian Togellius.

I also am a researcher and software engineer for the human computer interaction group at Northrop Grumman.

In my freetime I enjoy rock climbing, video games, and anime.....
