  abstract={The 3D structure of chromatin has a massive effect on its function. Because of this, it is desirable to have an understanding of the 3D structural organization of chromatin. To gain greater insight into the spatial organization of chromosomes and genomes and the functions they perform, chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, particularly Hi-C, have been developed. The Hi-C technology is widely used and well-known because of its ability to profile interactions for all read pairs in an entire genome. The advent of Hi-C has greatly expanded our understanding of the 3D genome, genome folding, gene regulation and has enabled the development of many 3D chromosome structure reconstruction methods.},
