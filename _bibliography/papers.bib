	abstract = {Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) has enhanced game content creation, yet challenges in controllability and limited training data persist. This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.},

	abstract = {The concept of an intelligent augmented reality (AR) assistant has significant, wide-ranging applications, with potential uses in medicine, military, and mechanics domains. Such an assistant must be able to perceive the environment and actions, reason about the environment state in relation to a given task, and seamlessly interact with the task performer. These interactions typically involve an AR headset equipped with sensors which capture video, audio, and haptic feedback. Previous works have sought to facilitate the development of intelligent AR assistants by visualizing these sensor data streams in conjunction with the assistant's perception and reasoning model outputs. However, existing visual analytics systems do not focus on user modeling or include biometric data, and are only capable of visualizing a single task session for a single performer at a time. Moreover, they typically assume a task involves linear progression from one step to the next. We propose a visual analytics system that allows users to compare performance during multiple task sessions, focusing on non-linear tasks where different step sequences can lead to success. In particular, we design visualizations for understanding user behavior through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data as a proxy for perception, attention, and memory as well as corresponding motion data (acceleration, angular velocity, and gaze). We distill these insights into embedding representations that allow users to easily select groups of sessions with similar behaviors. We provide two case studies that demonstrate how to use these visualizations to gain insights about task performance using data collected during helicopter copilot training tasks. Finally, we evaluate our approach by conducting an in-depth examination of a think-aloud experiment with five domain experts.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin has a massive effect on its function. Because of this, it is desirable to have an understanding of the 3D structural organization of chromatin. To gain greater insight into the spatial organization of chromosomes and genomes and the functions they perform, chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, particularly Hi-C, have been developed. The Hi-C technology is widely used and well-known because of its ability to profile interactions for all read pairs in an entire genome. The advent of Hi-C has greatly expanded our understanding of the 3D genome, genome folding, gene regulation and has enabled the development of many 3D chromosome structure reconstruction methods.},
