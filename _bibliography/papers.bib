  abstract={We propose a novel approach for 3D chromosome and genome structure reconstruction from Hi-C data using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach called ParticleChromo3D. This algorithm begins with a grouping of candidate solution locations for each chromosome bin, according to the particle swarm algorithm, and then iterates its position towards a global best candidate solution. While moving towards the optimal global solution, each candidate solution or particle uses its own local best information and a randomizer to choose its path. Using several metrics to validate our results, we show that ParticleChromo3D produces a robust and rigorous representation of the 3D structure for input Hi-C data. We evaluated our algorithm on simulated and real Hi-C data in this work. Our results show that ParticleChromo3D is more accurate than most of the existing algorithms for 3D structure reconstruction.},
